# Figures

```{r wqtrnds-supp, fig.cap = 'Sampled water quality data by week for April to July 2021 in response to wastewater discharge from Piney Point for (a) total nitrogen (mg/L), (b) chlorophyll-a (ug/L), and (c) secchi disk depth (meters).  Observations are aggregated by week and within assessment areas shown in Figure 1a.  Normal ranges for the month of observation (monthly baseline) and area are shown by the blue shaded areas. Normal ranges are defined as within +/-1 standard deviation of the mean for the month of observation from 2006 to 2021 for values collected at long-term monitoring sites within each area (Figure 1a).'}

Estimated trends are based on Generalized Additve Models fit to historical basline data from 2006 to early 2021.  Predicted trends from the historical models for dates during and after the Piney Point discharge are shown in thick lines (+/- 95% confidence), with observed samples overlaid on the plots.  Results are grouped by assessment areas shown in Figure 1a.'}

Estimates are not additive and are specific to each taxa.  Sample dates are noted by vertical grey lines in each plot. Diatoms are based on presence/absense of *Asterionellopsis sp*. and *Skeletonema sp*.  Note that frequency occurrence is not a precise measure of cell concentrations.'}
